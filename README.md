* import and deploy separately. You deploy an already imported revision to other environments instead of importing a new revision all the time
* node.js to read package.json dependencies and even then try to filter modules that already exist in Apigee
* deploy to several environments at the same time env=7,8
* promote dev-test
* description field to have git hash, etc like Morrisons
* swagger documentation generation
* check to see if there are policy files not referenced in default.xml files
