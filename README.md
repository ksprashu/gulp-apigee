* if file.contents is null (non-read) just ignore the file and pass it along
* description field to have git hash, etc like Morrisons
* node.js support
** read package.json and only zip modules within dependencies
** filter out modules that already deployed in Apigee
* swagger documentation generation
* check to see if there are policy files not referenced in default.xml files
* deploy to several environments at the same time env=7,8


There are no pre-determined recipes here - just building blocks for you to come up with your own workflows which is hopefully much more powerful.
